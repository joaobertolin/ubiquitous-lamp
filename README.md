# CellFlow

CellFlow is a novel organic life particle system that takes the simulation to new levels, building upon the foundational concepts of Clusters by Jeffrey Ventrella and Particle Life by Tom Mohr.

In CellFlow, it have been introduced core algorithmic differences that evolve the original particle interaction, leading to more complex and emergent behaviors.

I have documented all the changes of the core algoridtms in this video:
